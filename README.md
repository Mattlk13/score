# Score 

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/kunstmusik/score/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/kunstmusik/score)

A Clojure library for music score generation.  A note is a list of values and
a list of notes is a list of lists.

This library contains functions for various approaches to score generation. It
is made in a generic fashion so as to work with multiple approaches to 
modeling scores, as well as working with multiple backends.
